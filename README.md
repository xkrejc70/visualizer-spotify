# Task

## Visualizer of CI Jobs - 2023 Home Assignment

- Create a public repository on a code hosting service of your preference.
- Create an application which will fetch data from Spotify REST API and display it to a user in a simple table format.
- The data you need to fetch are top tracks of any artist (your choice).
- Display any information you find interesting with a minimum of track's name, id, album, popularity and genres.

Things to consider:
- The repository has to be public.
- Frequent commits with meaningful messages are a big plus. It allows to trace your thinking process better.
- Consider refactoring your code at the end. It is okay to use plenty of comments, debug outputs and so on. But get rid of them before submitting.
- The existing application uses Python and React, therefore we prefer for your solution to use these technologies as well. This is not a requirement, but it's highly suggested.
- Appearance of data visualization should fall somewhere between EXAMPLE1 & EXAMPLE2 (read on to unlock it). Outputting plain text in a way the EXAMPLE1 does is the bare minimum for the assignment.
- Project is open for personalization, have fun with it!
